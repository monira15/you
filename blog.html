    <h1 class="text-center text-5xl">Question</h1>
   <h2 class="text-center text-3xl">Q1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h2>
   <h2 class="text-center text-2xl">Answer:</h2>
   <p class="text-2xl">

    var: Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, depending on where they are declared. They are hoisted to the top of their containing function or script, and they can be accessed before their declaration.<br>
    
    let: Variables declared with let have block scope, which means they are limited to the block or statement where they are defined. They are also hoisted to the top of their block but are not accessible before their declaration within that block.<br>
    
    const: Variables declared with const also have block scope like let. However, they cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. They are a good choice for values that should not change during the program's execution.</p>
   <h2 class="text-center text-3xl">Q2: What are the use cases of null and undefined?</h2>
   <h2 class="text-center text-2xl">Answer:</h2>
   <p class="text-2xl">

    null: It is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or value assignment. It can be used to indicate that a variable should have no value or that an object property intentionally has no value.<br>

undefined: It represents the absence of a value or the value of a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value yet. It can occur when accessing a non-existent property of an object or when a function doesn't return a value explicitly.</p>
   <h2 class="text-center text-3xl">Q3: What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
   <h2 class="text-center text-2xl">Answer:</h2>
   <p class="text-2xl">

    REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. REST is not a protocol but a style of designing networked applications that use the HTTP protocol for communication.

Key principles of REST include statelessness (each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request), a uniform and consistent interface (using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-based URLs, and the use of standard HTTP status codes for indicating the outcome of a request.

RESTful APIs are widely used in web development for creating web services that can be accessed over the internet using standard HTTP methods. They are known for their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use, making them a popular choice for building web applications that communicate with servers and other services.</p>
